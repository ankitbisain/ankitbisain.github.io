i have some geometry handouts!!!

<a href = https://ankitbisain.github.io/files/RatioLemma.pdf>Ratio Lemma:</a> handout describing a length bashing technique based on the ratio lemma that i think is underutilized.

<a href = https://ankitbisain.github.io/files/Lengthbash.pdf>Length Bashing:</a> big handout on how to length bash geo

<a href = https://ankitbisain.github.io/files/DirectedAngleTrig.pdf>Trigonometry with Directed Angles:</a> seeks to rectify the fact that angles are taken mod 180, but sin and cos have period 360. a truly awful read but it works out i think.

<a href = https://ankitbisain.github.io/files/ProjectiveAndRatioLemma.pdf>Projective Geometry and the Ratio Lemma:</a> unfinished writeup of a connection between projective geometry and the ratio lemma that i tthink is cool
