i have some handouts:

<a href = https://ankitbisain.github.io/files/RatioLemma.pdf>Ratio Lemma:</a> handout describing a length bashing technique based on the ratio lemma that i think is underutilized.

<a href = https://ankitbisain.github.io/files/Lengthbash.pdf>Length Bashing:</a> big handout on how to length bash geo

<a href = https://ankitbisain.github.io/files/DirectedAngleTrig.pdf>Trigonometry with Directed Angles:</a> seeks to rectify the fact that angles are taken mod $180^\circ$, but $\sin$ and $\cos$ have period $360^\circ$. a truly awful read but it was important to me at some point.

<a href = https://ankitbisain.github.io/files/ProjectiveAndRatioLemma.pdf>Projective Geometry and the Ratio Lemma:</a> unfinished writeup of a connection between projective geometry and the ratio lemma that i thought was enlightening at some point.
